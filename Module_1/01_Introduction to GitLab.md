### **Module 1: Introduction to GitLab**

---

#### **Overview of GitLab**

GitLab is an open-source DevOps platform that enables development teams to manage the complete software development lifecycle. GitLab brings together version control, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), and much more in a single, cohesive application. It is designed to facilitate collaboration between team members and streamline processes, making it easier to deploy and manage applications.

#### **What is GitLab?**

GitLab is a web-based Git repository manager that provides features for source code management (SCM), CI/CD pipelines, issue tracking, code reviews, and more. With GitLab, developers can plan, create, verify, package, release, and monitor code within a single interface. 

GitLab supports private and public repositories, making it suitable for individual developers, teams, and enterprises. Beyond being a repository manager, GitLab helps in orchestrating end-to-end workflows, from version control to deployment, with built-in CI/CD capabilities.

#### **GitLab Features and Editions**

GitLab comes in several editions to suit different types of users:

1. **GitLab Free (Community Edition)**:

#### **GitLab vs. Other Git Platforms (GitHub, Bitbucket)**

While GitLab shares similar functionalities with other Git platforms, it offers a unique set of advantages:

| Feature                | **GitLab**                          | **GitHub**                          | **Bitbucket**                      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **CI/CD Integration**   | Built-in CI/CD pipelines available in all editions. | Limited CI/CD (GitHub Actions for CI/CD). | Integrated CI/CD (Bitbucket Pipelines). |
| **DevOps Lifecycle**    | Full DevOps lifecycle management (SCM, CI/CD, Monitoring, etc.). | Primarily source code management with additional features. | Source code management with CI/CD capabilities. |
| **Open Source**         | Free and open-source version (GitLab CE). | Proprietary with some free services. | Proprietary with free options. |
| **Self-Hosting**        | Can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure (GitLab CE and EE). | GitHub Enterprise for self-hosting. | Bitbucket Server available for self-hosting. |
| **Issue Tracking**      | Built-in issue tracking and project management tools. | Built-in issue tracking and Kanban boards (GitHub Projects). | Basic issue tracking with Jira integration. |
| **Security & Compliance**| Advanced security testing, compliance frameworks (in Ultimate). | GitHub Advanced Security (paid). | Security features mostly integrated via Atlassian tools. |

GitLab provides a more comprehensive DevOps toolchain than GitHub and Bitbucket, especially when it comes to integrated CI/CD, security, and compliance.

#### **Setting Up GitLab**

---

##### **1. Creating a GitLab Account**

To start using GitLab, you first need to create an account. Here's how:

1. **Go to the GitLab website**: Visit [https://gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com).
2. **Click on Sign up**: In the upper-right corner, click **Sign up** to create a new account.
3. **Provide account details**: Enter your username, email address, and password. Alternatively, you can sign up using an existing Google or GitHub account for easy integration.
4. **Verify email**: Once you submit your details, GitLab will send a verification email to the address provided. Verify your email to complete the account creation process.

---

##### **2. Navigating the GitLab Interface**

Once logged in, you'll be directed to the GitLab dashboard. Here's a breakdown of the key elements in the GitLab interface:

1. **Dashboard**: The default view when you log in. This shows your recent activity and access to your projects.
2. **Explore Projects**: Browse public projects or repositories from other GitLab users or groups.
3. **Create New Project**: You can create a new project or repository by clicking on the "New project" button.
4. **Groups**: Organize multiple related projects under a single group, which helps teams manage permissions, access, and project structure.
5. **Profile**: In the upper-right corner, you can access your profile settings, activity, and personal preferences.
6. **Activity Feed**: Displays the recent commits, merge requests, and other activities across your projects.

##### **3. GitLab Projects and Groups**

**Projects**:
- A project in GitLab is essentially a repository that stores your codebase and associated files (like documentation, configuration files, etc.).
- GitLab projects can be either **public** (visible to everyone) or **private** (only visible to selected users).
- Projects can contain issues, merge requests, pipelines (CI/CD), wikis, and other components related to development.

**How to Create a New Project**:
1. Click on **New project** from the dashboard or the **+** button on the top navigation bar.
2. Choose to either create a blank project, import an existing project from a different Git platform, or use a project template.
3. Provide a **project name** and description.
4. Choose the projectâ€™s visibility (public, internal, or private).
5. Click **Create project**.

**Groups**:
- A **Group** in GitLab is a collection of projects that can share permissions and access levels across multiple repositories.
- Groups help teams organize their projects under one umbrella, making it easier to manage access and collaboration.

**How to Create a New Group**:
1. From the sidebar, click **Groups > Your Groups**.
2. Click the **New Group** button.
3. Enter the group name and description.
4. Choose the visibility of the group.
5. Add members to the group and assign permissions (Owner, Maintainer, Developer, Reporter, or Guest).

Once the group is created, you can start adding projects to it and managing access for team members.
