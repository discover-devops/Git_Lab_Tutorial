### Artifacts in GitLab: What They Are and How They Work

#### 1. **What are Artifacts?**
   - **Artifacts** in GitLab are files generated by your CI/CD pipeline that you want to save and share across different stages or jobs.
   - They typically include build outputs like binaries, compiled code, logs, test results, or any other files you may need later in your pipeline.

#### 2. **How Artifacts Work:**
   - Artifacts are defined within a job in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
   - When a job runs, the specified files are collected as artifacts and are made available for subsequent jobs or stages.
   - Artifacts can also be downloaded and reviewed through the GitLab UI after a pipeline completes.

#### 3. **Defining Artifacts in a Job:**
   - The `artifacts` keyword is used within a job to specify the files or directories you want to save.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     build-job:
       stage: build
       script:
         - mkdir build
         - echo "Building the project..." > build/output.txt
       artifacts:
         paths:
           - build/output.txt
     ```

#### 4. **Key Components of Artifacts:**
   - **`paths`:** 
     - Specifies the files or directories to be collected as artifacts.
     - Example:
       ```yaml
       artifacts:
         paths:
           - build/
           - logs/
       ```
   - **`expire_in`:**
     - Specifies how long the artifacts should be kept. After this time, GitLab automatically deletes them.
     - Example:
       ```yaml
       artifacts:
         expire_in: 1 week
       ```
     - Default is unlimited if not specified.
   - **`when`:**
     - Specifies when to upload the artifacts. It can be set to `on_success`, `on_failure`, or `always`.
     - Example:
       ```yaml
       artifacts:
         when: always
       ```
   - **`exclude`:**
     - Allows you to exclude certain files from being collected as artifacts.
     - Example:
       ```yaml
       artifacts:
         paths:
           - build/
         exclude:
           - build/temp/*
       ```
   - **`reports`:**
     - Artifacts can also be used to create reports like code quality, test results, coverage, etc.
     - Example:
       ```yaml
       artifacts:
         reports:
           junit: report.xml
       ```

#### 5. **Using Artifacts in Subsequent Jobs:**
   - Artifacts from one job can be used in later jobs, even in different stages.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     stages:
       - build
       - test

     build-job:
       stage: build
       script:
         - mkdir build
         - echo "Building the project..." > build/output.txt
       artifacts:
         paths:
           - build/

     test-job:
       stage: test
       script:
         - cat build/output.txt
     ```
   - In this example, `test-job` can access the artifact `build/output.txt` created by `build-job`.

#### 6. **Artifact Retention and Cleanup:**
   - Artifacts take up storage space, so GitLab provides options to manage their retention.
   - **Retention Policies:**
     - Define how long to keep artifacts using the `expire_in` keyword.
   - **Manual Cleanup:**
     - Artifacts can be manually deleted from the GitLab UI.

#### 7. **Security Considerations:**
   - Artifacts should be handled carefully as they can contain sensitive data like logs, configurations, or compiled binaries.
   - Use proper access controls and retention policies to manage artifacts securely.

#### 8. **Example: Comprehensive `.gitlab-ci.yml` with Artifacts**
   ```yaml
   stages:
     - build
     - test
     - deploy

   build-job:
     stage: build
     script:
       - mkdir build
       - echo "Building the project..." > build/output.txt
     artifacts:
       paths:
         - build/
       expire_in: 1 week

   test-job:
     stage: test
     script:
       - cat build/output.txt
     artifacts:
       paths:
         - test-results.xml
       reports:
         junit: test-results.xml

   deploy-job:
     stage: deploy
     script:
       - echo "Deploying application..."
   ```

In this example:
- The `build-job` creates an artifact (`output.txt` in the `build/` directory), which is retained for one week.
- The `test-job` uses this artifact and generates a test report (`test-results.xml`) that is also stored as an artifact.
- `deploy-job` runs after both previous stages and can proceed knowing that the artifacts were processed as required.

By using artifacts, you can ensure smooth and efficient data flow between different jobs and stages in your CI/CD pipeline.
