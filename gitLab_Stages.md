### how stages and stage keywords work in GitLab CI/CD, presented in a clear and structured manner:

### Understanding GitLab Stages

1. **Definitions:**
   - **`stage` Keyword:**
     - Used within a job to specify the stage that job belongs to.
     - Example:
       ```yaml
       job_name:
         stage: build
         script:
           - echo "Building..."
       ```
   - **`stages` Keyword:**
     - Used at the top level of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to define the order of stages.
     - Example:
       ```yaml
       stages:
         - build
         - test
         - deploy
       ```

2. **Pipeline Execution:**
   - **Default Behavior:**
     - If no stages are defined, GitLab places all jobs in the default `test` stage.
     - Jobs are executed in parallel by default.
   - **Defining Execution Order:**
     - To control the execution order, define the `stages` keyword and list the stages in the order you want them to execute.

3. **Example Pipeline:**
   ```yaml
   stages:
     - build
     - test
     - deploy

   build-job:
     stage: build
     script:
       - echo "This message is from build-job"

   test-job:
     stage: test
     script:
       - echo "This message is from test-job"

   deploy-job:
     stage: deploy
     script:
       - echo "This message is from deploy-job"
   ```

4. **Execution Details:**
   - **Parallel Execution:**
     - Jobs within the same stage run in parallel.
     - Example:
       ```yaml
       stages:
         - build
         - test

       build-job:
         stage: build
         script:
           - echo "Building..."

       test-job-1:
         stage: test
         script:
           - echo "Running test 1..."

       test-job-2:
         stage: test
         script:
           - echo "Running test 2..."
       ```
     - `test-job-1` and `test-job-2` will run in parallel.

   - **Sequential Execution:**
     - Jobs in a stage run after all jobs from the previous stage complete successfully.
     - Example:
       ```yaml
       stages:
         - build
         - test
         - deploy

       build-job:
         stage: build
         script:
           - echo "Building..."

       test-job:
         stage: test
         script:
           - echo "Testing..."

       deploy-job:
         stage: deploy
         script:
           - echo "Deploying..."
       ```
     - `test-job` will not start until `build-job` completes. Similarly, `deploy-job` waits for `test-job` to finish.

5. **Predefined Stages:**
   - GitLab provides five predefined stages: `.pre`, `build`, `test`, `deploy`, and `.post`.
     - **`.pre`:** Runs before any other stages.
     - **`build`:** Typically used for building code.
     - **`test`:** Used for running tests.
     - **`deploy`:** For deployment tasks.
     - **`.post`:** Runs after all other stages.
   - You don't need to explicitly define the order of these stages unless you want to override the default behavior.
     - Example with predefined stages:
       ```yaml
       .pre-job:
         stage: .pre
         script:
           - echo "Running pre-job..."

       build-job:
         stage: build
         script:
           - echo "Building..."

       test-job:
         stage: test
         script:
           - echo "Testing..."

       deploy-job:
         stage: deploy
         script:
           - echo "Deploying..."

       .post-job:
         stage: .post
         script:
           - echo "Running post-job..."
       ```
     - GitLab will execute `.pre-job` first and `.post-job` last, with `build-job`, `test-job`, and `deploy-job` in between.

6. **Overriding Default Behavior:**
   - If you want to define custom stages, use the `stages` keyword at the top of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
   - Example of overriding default stages:
     ```yaml
     stages:
       - test
       - build
       - deploy

     test-job:
       stage: test
       script:
         - echo "Running tests..."

     build-job:
       stage: build
       script:
         - echo "Building..."

     deploy-job:
       stage: deploy
       script:
         - echo "Deploying..."
     ```

7. **Handling Missing Stages:**
   - If a job refers to a stage not defined in the `stages` list, GitLab will throw an error.
   - Example of an error scenario:
     ```yaml
     test-job:
       stage: test
       script:
         - echo "Testing..."

     # Missing stages definition will cause an error
     ```
   - Solution: Define all stages used in jobs in the `stages` list.

By understanding and correctly using the `stage` and `stages` keywords, you can effectively manage job execution order and optimize your CI/CD pipelines in GitLab.
